T-SNE algorithm did a fairly decent job in visualizing the clusters, too. But, there were a few noticable differences when comparing it's resulting plots to PCA's resulting plots. \n","\n","One major difference between the plots produced by PCA and T-SNE is that T-SNE's plots seemed to have it's clusters overlapping with eachother more so than in PCA's plots. For example, if you look at the [**2-D plot**](#PCA_2D) fomed from PCA, you see three distinct sections of the data-points with strict, visible borders separating each colour into groups. Whereas, if you look at the [**2-D**](#T-SNE_2D) plot formed from T-SNE, you, again, see three sections formed within the data-points, but this time, datapoints between each cluster seem to 'intermingle' and overlap more.\n","\n","The other major difference between the plots created by PCA and the plots created by T-SNE, is the shape. Because both PCA and T-SNE perform dimensionality reduction in very different ways (and with different objectives), the resulting shape or distibution of the points produced by the algorithms will almost always be very different.\n","\n","Bear in mind that the plots resulting from the T-SNE algorithm are quite variable, in that they depend very heavily on the value chosen for `perplexity`."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"ad476100d7058787007d4b9bd549f17a3b1510c6"},"source":["<a id=\"8\"></a>\n","# Conclusion:\n","\n","So there you have it: two interesting methods to view clusters formed on high-dimensional data.\n","One method was the standard and reliable PCA algorithm, and the other method was the somewhat more interesting and exotic T-SNE algorithm.\n","\n","Both algorithms definitely have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to performing this task, and I'd imagine that the effectiveness of each algorithm depends largely on the type of data being given. So, in the end, it's largely up to the user which algorithm he or she prefers to use when visualizing clusterings on high-dimensional data."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"39843a1bea50d6505535a75896ccf7c5fd92a145"},"source":["<a id=\"9\"></a>\n","# Closing Remarks:\n","\n","I learned about quite alot in the making of this kernel -- about clusterability, perplexity, how to use plotly, the importance of feature-engineering, and much more. In all honesty, this was a ton of fun to make and has only further deepened my interest in [unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning) and data visualization. I hope to make more kernels like this in the future and to continue to sharpen my skills in this area.\n","\n","If you've got any feedback for me: please leave a comment below, as I'd love to hear what you've got to say.
